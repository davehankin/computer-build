## Notes
Started building in the office on Friday afternoon, need to bring tools from home.

CPU is upgrade from previous computers (5700g -> 8700g). CPU socket is AM5 so mobo is also an upgrade (B550 -> B650), and RAM (DDR4 -> DDR5).

Need mobo manual to figure out how to install SSD. No manual in the box, get online.

Wraith Spire cooler comes with the CPU. Has thermal paste already, although it doesn't really look like paste. Online says it's fine.

Didn't find a Youtube video for the build, didn't need it in the end.

Couldn't find the power supply I wanted, could only get 550W but hopefully is fine.

**Need to buy a fan splitter**

First time I plugged it in nothing happened. Problem was the F_PANEL connector, I had the power LED plugged in wrong.

Downloaded Windows onto a USB key.

Switched off computer, plugged in USB key and switched it on again.

Installed Windows.

No ethernet cable, procedure to get wifi working:
1. Download driver (from mobo website) to USB key (on another computer)
2. Plug USB key into new computer
3. During Windows install hit SHIFT+F10 to bring up a cmd prompt
4. Enter "C:\>D:\driver_filename.exe"

This should install the driver and then can lo in to wifi, may need to hit power button to restart first.

Windows PIN is 834277
