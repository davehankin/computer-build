Notes from building the first company computers
Went with a Ryzen 7 5700g APU to keep the price down, no need for separate graphics card.
First 2 computers were bought from PLE computers. I bought a third one for myself (a couple weeks later) from PC Case Gear bc PLE didn't have the mobo in stock
I made these notes while building the second computer.
